Project name: Airbus Ship Detection Challenge
Project description:
    This project focuses on detecting ships in satellite images and drawing aligned
    bounding boxes around them. The dataset includes a mix of images, some containing no
    ships, while others may feature multiple ships of varying sizes. Ships can appear in
    diverse environments such as open sea, docks, marinas, and more. To accomplish this
    task, we employ a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for accurate detection and
    localization.
